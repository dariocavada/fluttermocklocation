# fluttermocklocation

This Flutter plugin is designed to assist developers in setting a mock location on Android devices during the testing phase of applications that require location data, such as geofencing apps, and others that rely on GPS positioning. 

By enabling the simulation of location data, developers can ensure their applications behave as expected in various geographic locations without the need to physically move the device. This tool is essential for thorough testing of location-based features, ensuring a wide range of scenarios can be tested efficiently and effectively.

To use the application based on this plugin, please enable Developer Options on your Android device. 

Within Developer Options, select "Select mock location app" and choose your app.
